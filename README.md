# Dynamic-graph-releases--Re-identification-active-attacks
Simulators of periodically released social graphs under active attacks

This project was originally developed by Ema Kepuska, as part of her master's thesis at the University of Luxembourg
(original repository: emakepuska2/Dynamic-graph-releases--Re-identification-active-attacks).

I am adding to this forked version some additional tools previously developed within other projects, 
or to be developed in the future.
